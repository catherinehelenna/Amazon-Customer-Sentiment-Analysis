### Background of the project

Being the second highest brand value after Google in 2022, Amazon is a globally well-known online retailer and web service provider. Having 300 million active users in 2022 shows how big the volumes of transactions happening in the platform which also translates into large number of the customer feedbacks on the products.

### Problem Statement

Investigate the popularity of Airbnb room types in New York City, specifically those with an availability of less than 120 days. Analyze room types, neighborhood variances, and pricing influences on the minimum booking duration for guests, with the goal of completing the study within a month.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What can you find in this project?

Data cleaning, visualizations, and statistical studies to give insights for the next hosting strategies.

### Finally, the recommendation for the hosting strategies!

Setting up more listings on Staten Island for 'Shared room' can fulfill the observed demand, leading to potential higher prices. Here are the consideration points:

- The geospatial heatmap distribution of popular Airbnb rooms suggests that Staten Island has less Airbnb listing density compared to Manhattan and Brooklyn although its 'Shared room' is most on demand.

- The pie chart points out how low 'Shared room' proportion is compared to other room types in the neighbourhoods. So, the competition for booking is also less.

- It is possible to set up high price on the listing since the guests tend to stay in longer periods for more expensive Airbnb rooms.
