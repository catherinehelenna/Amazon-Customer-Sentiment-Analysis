### Background of the project

Being the second highest brand value after Google in 2022, Amazon is a globally well-known online retailer and web service provider. Having 300 million active users in 2022 shows how big the volumes of transactions happening in the platform which also translates into large number of the customer feedbacks on the products. It is crucial to do sentiment analysis on these feedbacks so that Amazon can maintain as well as improve its products and services for customers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Problem Statement

A natural language processing (NLP) model is built to streamline the sentiment analysis process of Amazon products. Based on the product rating, the sentiments are divided into three categories: negative (0-2), neutral (2-3), and positive (4-5).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What can you find in this project?

Data cleaning, visualizations, NLP model building process, as well as the deployment folder to make the web app.

### Some notes about the model

- You need to use Google Colab to run the modelling program since it's very heavy.
- The model is good at detecting positive sentiments and still needing improvements on categorizing neutral and negative sentiments.
